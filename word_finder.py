"""
Problem:

    The function "find" takes in two strings as input, called
    word and s.  It should search for word in s.

    If s starts with word - print "Start"
    If s finished with word - print "End"
    If word is in the middle somewhere - print "Middle"
    If word does not appear anywhere- print "Not found"

    Word will only appear once in s.

    The search should be case-insensitive.

Tests:

    >>> find("Hell", "Hello world")
    Start
    >>> find("old", "If I were so bold")
    End
    >>> find("Over", "I would love some dover sole")
    Middle
    >>> find("Piece", "Peter piper picked a peck of pickled pepper")
    Not found
