"""
Problem:

    Given a string, s, we can compose a substring using
    every second letter, starting with the first character.
    eg. "HelloWorld" -> "Hlool"

    The function 'sub_search' takes in two strings, s and
    word.

    If word is present in s - print "Found in original"
    If word is present in the substring - print "Found in substring"
    Otherwise, print "Not found"

    The search should be case-insensitive.

Tests:

    >>> sub_search("No", "Dont stop me now!")
    Found in original
    >>> sub_search("hag", "I'm having such a good time")
    Found in substring
    >>> sub_search("vin", "Im having a ball")
    Found in original
    >>> sub_search("ago", "If you want to have a good time just give me a call")
    Found in substring
    >>> sub_search("fun", "Dont stop me now!")
    Not found
